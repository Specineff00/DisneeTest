# DisneeTest

## Approach
For this project I opted to code using The Composable Architecture, Alamofire, and CardStack. TCA was chosen mainly as it was a challenge, I have been working in this environment for a while now and thought it would show off my skills. The other libraries were for speed of use as only 4 hours were permitted 

## What were your priorities, and why?
My priorities when it came to this project is to fill the MVP of the app while keeping closely to designs and if there was a time, to make it testable. The task will always have more to be done and improved upon, but these were the main points. Developers have a tendency to have a perfectionist attitude to code and that can be great but a balance must be struck between speed and quality especially in a business setting when deadlines and keeping within budget is key.

## If you had two additional days, what would you have tackled next?
I think anything I add to this app would be out of scope of the designs given but I think a clean up of small things like:
- Better error handling to display clearer information to the user.
- Localised Strings 

## What changes would you make to the visual design of the app?
- Make it more tinder like and bring the size of these 'cards' down to a reasonable, manageable size.
- Table view / list is a bit plain. We could do better on it

## What additional features would you add to the app?
- Have a way to go back after swiping as there's no way to return to the previous card
- A reset function.
- The API provides a way to filter and therefore can be implemented rather than list sorted by popularity.
- We could add a sort function for specific criteria we're looking for i.e Characters sorted by the most short films. 
- A load function being called several cards from the bottom to load more cards so the list is 'endless'.
- A way to favourite certain characters
